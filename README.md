# Paw_Pals--Capstone

‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview:
This app will connect pet owners and locals who offer dog walking services. This app focuses on those pet owners who are either very busy and not home enough, medically unable to provide the exercise for their pet or those who have had a hard time training their pet. This also allows individuals who are interested in pet care to make extra money or work full time hours by setting their own schedule based around their availability. The app will include a sliding scale pricing ($5-$25/walk or hour) to accommodate lower income individuals as well. 

üì≤ Interfaces:
This app will have both a ‚Äúdog walker‚Äù interface and a ‚Äúpet owner‚Äù interface. 

üê∂ The dog walker interface would consist of the following:

‚Ä¢	Log-In/ Create Profile (Name, City, Email, Phone Number, Profile Photo)

‚Ä¢	Provide availability- both days and times (calendar function)

‚Ä¢	Brief questionnaire about service preference:
1.	Willing to work on a sliding scale?

4.	Willing to drive outside of local area (up to 20kms) to accommodate more clients?
5.	Contact preference: Text or In-app chat only
